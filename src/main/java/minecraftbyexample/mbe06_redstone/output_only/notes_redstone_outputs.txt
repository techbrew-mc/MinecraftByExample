The two blocks in this package are redstone power sources; they provide power to other blocks.

The three key methods they use are
  public boolean canProvidePower(IBlockState state)
  public int getWeakPower(IBlockState blockState, IBlockAccess blockAccess, BlockPos pos, EnumFacing side)
  public int getStrongPower(IBlockState blockState, IBlockAccess blockAccess, BlockPos pos, EnumFacing side)
